These are basic calculators for CNC machining.
They are written in Python and run in a VSCode window.
Just hit "run"  and input the values thst it asks for.


These were designed for me, so they are as-is with no planned updates or changes. If I do decide to update them, I will upload them.

The c√∂Chip Thinning calculator will output IPM, RPM, chip thinning adjustment, MRR and Spindle HP.

The Ball End Mill calculator will adjust IPM and RPM based on end mill diameter and cutting depth

The Inside Corner adjustment calculatoe will adjust feed rate for an inside corner based on tool diameter and corner radius.
